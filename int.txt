1.Difference between @Controller and @RestController in Spring MVC/BOOT..
The @Controller is a annotation to mark class as Controller Class in Spring
 While @RestController is used in REST Web services and similar to @Controller and @ResponseBody.
The @Controller annotation indicates that the class is controller like web Controller while 
@RestController annotation indicates that the class is controller where
 @RequestMapping Method assume @ResponseBody by Default(i.e REST APIs).
The key difference is that you do not need to use @ResponseBody on each and every handler method once you annotate the class with @RestController.
@Controller create a Map of Model Object and find a view while @RestController simply return object and object data directly written into http response as JSON orXML.
This can be also done with @Controller annotation and @ResponseBody annotation but since this is the default behaviour of RESTful Web Services. Spring introduced @RestController which is combined behaviour of @Controller and @ResponseBody together.
Example
Following are Example Code which are Equal in Spring.
@ Controller
@Controller
@ResponseBody
Public class MVCController{
}
@ RestController
@RestController
public class MVCController{
}

2. How you can consume xml data format.
=Reading XML file in Java is much different from reading other files like .docx and .txt because XML file contains data between the tags.
 Java provides many ways to parse an XML file. There are two parsers in Java which parses an XML file:

Java DOM Parser
Java SAX Parser
.Step 1: Create a simple Java project.
Step 2: Create a class file and provide a class file name. We have created the class file with the name ReadXMLFileExample1.

Step 3: Write the following code.

Step 4: Download dom-2.3.0-jaxb-1.0.6.jar file: Click here...

Step 5: Create a lib folder in the project.

Step 6: Copy dom-2.3.0-jaxb-1.0.6.jar file and paste into the lib folder.

Step 7: Set the class path:

Right-click on the project->Build Path->Configure Build Path->Add External JARs->Select the JAR file->click on Open button->Apply and Close.

Step 8: Create an XML file. We have created an XML file with name XMLFile.xml and write the following data into it.

4. What is bydefault data formart in webservices...
=is it xml or json.

6.How we can manage session in webfull restservies.
=REST architecture treats every content as a resource. These resources can be Text Files, Html Pages, Images, Videos or Dynamic Business Data.
 REST Server simply provides access to resources and REST client accesses and modifies the resources. Here each resource is identified by URIs/ Global IDs.

8.How did you test Restfull webservices.
=Steps for Testing REST API
Step 1) Open Advanced REST client. ...
Step 2) Enter the URL of API to test. ...
Step 3) Select the HTTP method. ...
Step 4) Provide Headers set. ...
Step 5) Confirm the Headers set. ...
Step 6) Provide required Body content. ...
Step 7) Submit the details to start the test.
======================================
9.How did you mock Restfull webservices.
=Creating a Simple Mock
Create a new REST project in Soap UI following the screens below. Click the REST button on the toolbar (circled in red). ...
Create a Mock for the REST project. Right-click on the project and select New REST MockService from the menu. ...
Add a mock response. ...
Start the mock service. ...
Test it out!..

10.Waht is fire api in restfull webservices.
A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with
 RESTful web services. 
REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding.

11. What are varous componets of webservices.
===================================
12. what is stream.
=Introduced in Java 8, the Stream API is used to process collections of objects. A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result.
The features of Java stream are –
A stream is not a data structure instead it takes input from the Collections, Arrays or I/O channels.
Streams don’t change the original data structure, they only provide the result as per the pipelined methods.
Each intermediate operation is lazily executed and returns a stream as a result, hence various intermediate operations can be pipelined. Terminal operations mark the end of the stream and return the result.
==============================
13.What is Mapping.
=The definition of mapping is making a map, or a matching process where the points of one set are matched against the points of another set.
The purpose of User Experience Mapping is to understand what customers go through and improve the quality of your customer experience, ensuring 
consistency and a seamless experience at all touchpoints and across all channels.
